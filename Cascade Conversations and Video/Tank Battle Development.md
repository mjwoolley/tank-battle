# Tank Battle Game Development
Date: March 17, 2025

## Project Overview
Development of a tank battle game with AI-controlled enemy tanks that can intelligently navigate, pursue players, and handle obstacles.

## Key Features Implemented

### Wall System
- Reduced barrier wall thickness to 6 pixels
- Added border walls around the playing field
- Maintained L-shaped cover points

### AI Navigation and Targeting
1. Line of Sight Implementation
   - AI only engages when it has direct line of sight
   - Cannot track or shoot through walls
   - Remembers last known player position

2. Smart Wall Avoidance
   - Proactive wall detection using 5 look-ahead points
   - 16-direction scanning for clear paths
   - Intelligent path finding around obstacles
   - Reverse maneuvers when too close to walls

3. Player Pursuit
   - Tracks last known player position
   - Actively moves to investigate when losing sight
   - Returns to patrol after reaching last known position

### State Management
- PATROLLING: Default state when no player contact
- PURSUING: Moving to last known player position
- ENGAGING: Active combat when player is visible

## Development Process
The development focused on iterative improvements to the AI behavior, particularly:
1. Initial implementation of basic movement and targeting
2. Addition of line of sight mechanics
3. Enhancement of wall avoidance and navigation
4. Refinement of pursuit and patrol behaviors

## Next Steps
Potential areas for enhancement:
- More sophisticated patrol patterns
- Advanced combat tactics
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Multiple AI difficulty levels
